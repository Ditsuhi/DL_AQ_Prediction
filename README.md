# A set of deep learning algorithms for air quality prediction applications

Machine/deep learning technologies can perform predictive analyses with higher accuracy. Two machine/deep learning algorithms are introduced here to predict air quality, including grid-based (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM)) and graph-based (Attention Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (A3T-GCN)) algorithms. 

The data were obtained from Open data portal of the Madrid City Council (https://bit.ly/2TZzwEo) and the generated dataset using Arcpy library is available in the Zenodo repository (BiConvLSTM: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6076631; A3T-GCN: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7308425).
